Altered vaginal flora that does not meet criteria for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. If signs and/or symptoms persist, repeat testing may be warranted.  Interpretive criteria have only been established for pre-menopausal women and post-menopausal women on hormone replacement therapy. As low estrogen levels alter vaginal flora, results should be interpreted with caution in post-menopausal women. Refer to the on line laboratory manual or contact the Microbiology Laboratory ___ for further information.  Note, neither lactobacilli nor Gardnerella/Bacteroides/Mobiluncus morphotypes observed. The absence of these morphotypes likely represents normal flora in post-menopausal women.  "
